# Binary Searchtree

This was written in the course Algorithms and Softwaredesign.
The task was to implement a binary searchtree that would be able to handle tree nodes, count (traverse) and count each node and also take account into node value.

The assignment was dealed out with the ITree interface already in place and the task was to implement all interface functions by yourself.

The program also needed to import files and traverse the counts for that file.

I must warn that this script is not the best example of following standard naming conventions but I will blame it on being a student and not knowing better :-)
